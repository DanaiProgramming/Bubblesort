# Bubblesort

Attempt on making bubblesort algorithm that sorts in ascending order a doubly linked list.
For the implementation of this sorting algorithm, I created 3 different functions:
a)	A function that finds how many nodes are in a list (length of list)
b)	A function that swaps two nodes
c)	A function that (using the functions above) implements the bubble sort and actually sorts in ascending order a doubly linked list

Of course, for all three functions I created some tests to make sure the program is working properly.
The bubble sort functions start at line 107
and the respective testing functions start at line 221

Note that I deleted some of the functions from the lists assignment that were not useful in this program.
Also, from the lists assignment, I included some of the functions useful for this program (start, insert, etc.), but I deleted all the testing functions for these (assuming they’re correct as they’re already tested in the lists program) in order to make things a bit cleaner and separated from the bit I added.
Finally, in this program I included some of the testing helping functions like toString, toList and check, in order to make my testing in the same neat manner as the lists program.
